                <h3>KEEP IN MIND WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT</h3>
                <p>Think of fastpacking as the marriage of running and backpacking, in which runners take the bare minimum of overnight equipment on multi-day trail runs. It was first invented by backpackers seeking lighter loads, but in the last few years
                    more runners are catching on to the sport. And why not? With advances in gear design, an overnight pack can now weigh less than five poundsâ€”light enough to run with comfortably.
                    <br> <br> In a nutshell, you pick a trail route, pack some minimal overnight gear, run all day, sleep at a basic camp, then do it all over again the next day. It can be as easy as bagging a loop trail that's slightly too long to run
                    in a day, or it can be as ambitious as the Appalachian Trail.</p>

                <h3>CHOOSE THE RIGHT ROUTE</h3>
                <p>As important as it is to have a good set of shoes, choosing the right route is the key to your enjoyment while out exploring - whether this involves forging your own path or following an existing one. We have a collections of routes that we love and think you'll enjoy as well.
We've devided our routes into four distinct categories. <br>  1. Day Trips - for those just getting started or for when you don't have enough time for anything longer. 2. Over Nights - These can be as simple as a 24 hours round trip to as many days as you can imagine on the trail. 3. Loops - so you can leave your car and return to it. 4. Thru - these typically take the most planning trying to go from point A to point B. </p>

                <h3>WHAT TO BRING AND WHAT TO LEAVE</h3>
                <p>Fast-packing is at its core ultra-light back-packing taking to the next level. The general rule of theumb is you can get by with less and you will be more comfortable out on the trail with less. There are a few essentails that we have found are best not to leave behind though. These include water filtration, stuff to make food with and equiptment to keep you warm and your feet safe. We love titanium products because they are light and strong but we also love products that cost less and are still as functional. <br> <br>Remember at the end of the day the lighter your pack the happier your back. </p>
